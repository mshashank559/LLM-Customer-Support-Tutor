_AI-Powered Real-Time Coaching for Customer Support Agents_

## 📖 Overview

This project develops an **AI-powered mentor system** that provides **real-time coaching suggestions** to customer support agents. The system helps improve response quality, tone, empathy, technical accuracy, and policy adherence during live chat conversations.

The project simulates a **24-week Data Science Internship** and combines **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, and an **interactive training interface** to enhance customer success outcomes.

----------

## 🎯 Objectives

-   Analyze customer support conversations and score response quality.
    
-   Provide **real-time AI coaching suggestions** (<2s latency).
    
-   Improve **tone, empathy, and accuracy** in agent responses.
    
-   Develop a **Streamlit-based training and simulation platform**.
    
-   Validate business impact with **ROI analysis** and **performance metrics**.
    

----------

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

-   **Programming**: Python 3.8+
    
-   **LLMs & Prompting**: Hugging Face Transformers, LangChain
    
-   **NLP Processing**: spaCy, NLTK
    
-   **Machine Learning**: scikit-learn, pandas, numpy
    
-   **Real-time Processing**: asyncio, threading
    
-   **Interface**: Streamlit, Plotly, matplotlib
    
-   **Database**: SQLite (dev), PostgreSQL (prod)
